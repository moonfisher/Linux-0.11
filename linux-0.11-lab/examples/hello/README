Now, this is a very basic root file system for linux 0.1x.
I wll add more things to this release soon.

This release can only do little things. you can test vi, ls,
mkdir etc. Just for testing with kernel source code.

NOTE:
When testing floppy root (as running bochsrc-fd), when showing
the message of " Insert root floppy and press ENTER", JUST 
press the Enter key. I have already attached the root floppy 
to the 'B:' diskette driver.

The system will panic unpredicatablly. Use at your own risk!

Changelog:

	This packet now contains gcc 1.40 tools. Just execute
