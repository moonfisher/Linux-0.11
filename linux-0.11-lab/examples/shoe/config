# The run entry specifies a list of standalone images to load.

#run		/etc/system/db

# The boot entry locates an image put together using build. This
# entry will be used if the load by components option fails.

boot		/usr/src/linux/linux/Image

# The following entry is passed to the kernel and thence to the
# tty driver. It indicates the type of keyboard that is connected
# to the console. The number is the scan code for the relevant
# key. Please refer to the tty driver for more details.

setenv scancode 13

# The following entry is passed to the kernel. It is used to limit
# the processor type for testing and compatibility:
#
# below 286:	forces 286's and 386's to use (unprotected) 8088 mode
# 287 to 385:	forces 386's to use protected 286 mode
# above 385:	no restriction

setenv processor 386

# The following entries locate the components of the Minix kernel.
# The entries will be used in order to load and build Minix on the
# fly. The "-s" option in front of a component name says to strip the
# symbol table for the component.

fs		/etc/system/fs
init		/etc/system/init
mm		/etc/system/mm
kernel		/etc/system/kernel

# The following entries specify the system devices. The possibilities are
#
# rootdev:	the root device (default /dev/ram).
# ramimagedev:	the device to copy the RAM image from (default /dev/fd0).
#		This is only used when rootdev is /dev/ram.
# ramsize:	the size of the RAM disk (default 0). This is overridden
#		by the size of ramimagedev when rootdev is /dev/ram.
#
# The directory is not scanned for the device names so the following
# correspondences are hard coded (x is any number):
#
# /dev/ram:	device 1, minor 0 (the RAM disk)
# /dev/fdx:	device 2, minor x (floppy x)
# /dev/atx:	device 2, minor x (also floppy x - size is not checked)
# /dev/hdx:	device 3, minor x (hard disk x / 5, partition x % 5)
# bootdev:	the boot device, encoded in the same way.
#
# The leading "/dev/" is optional. All other names are regarded as illegal
# and replaced by /dev/ram.

setdev rootdev bootdev
#videomode 3 8
