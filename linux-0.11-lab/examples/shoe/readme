			    ShoeLace Installation
			    =====================

I suggest that you practice making a bootable floppy *before* destroying your
hard disk. Firstly, read *all* the .doc files to familiarise yourself with the
components of the system. With Minix 1.4b or earlier, you will have to use
the supplied boot.h. Copy this file to /usr/include/minix. If you are using
Minix 1.5.0 or later, you can use the boot.h file that is supplied with the
system. All the source files for shoelace should be placed in /usr/src/shoelace.
Now compile all the sources to get:

	/shoelace
	/etc/laceup
	/etc/bootlace
	/etc/winiboot

along with the files:

	/etc/config
	/etc/disktab

Now put a file system on a floppy. Copy a /bin/sh, login, etc onto the floppy.
Don't worry if you miss something out, you can always try again when you've
worked out what's missing. What you basically want is the *bare* minimum of
what's on your hard disk to get a system *up*.

Now copy the following files onto the floppy:

	/shoelace
	/etc/config

As mentioned in laceup.doc, you can copy more, but for the time being, you can
get by with these two. Now:

	laceup /dev/fd0 5.25dsdd

I'm assuming you're fiddling with drive 0 and fiddling with 5.25" dsdd
floppies. Modify to suit your own taste. In addition, you may need to edit
disktab to add extra entries.

Now hold your breath and boot the floppy. It should grind and grunt and you
should eventually see the ShoeLace sign on. ShoeLace should complain about not
being able to find anything. This is good.

Now you can reboot and copy on to the floppy your Minix kernel image. You can
choose whatever method you like at this point. Keep playing with the floppy
system until you feel comfortable with how everything goes together and how to
edit /etc/config on the floppy to suit your own taste. You can also play with
ShoeLace in its interactive mode.

The following is an image of a boot floppy that I use. It is basically the ram
disk image that comes with the Minix distribution with a few modifications:

Once you're happy you can then set up the same files on your hard disk. Now
you are ready to install the bootstrap onto your hard disk partition. Use:

	laceup /dev/hd1 wini

to install it in the first hard disk partition.

			*****************
			* W A R N I N G *
			*****************
	If your hard disk is partitioned, do not install the
	bootstrap on /dev/hd0 or you will destroy your hard
	disk partition table.

	You must laceup the partition from which you wish to
	boot Minix.

			    WiniBoot Installation
			    =====================

WiniBoot allows you to select which hard disk partition you wish to boot.
Those who have not partitioned their hard disks may skip this section.
WiniBoot is always installed on /dev/hd0 --- never in one of the partitions.
If you do so, you will overwrite your previously installed bootstrap.

			***************************
			* C O M P L I C A T I O N *
			***************************


	Before WiniBoot will work, it is necessary that the partition
	table accurately reflect where the Minix file system actually
	starts. This is important for those with file systems created
	*before* 1.5.0. In old file systems, the Minix wini driver
	rounded up the parition start sector to an even number. Thus
	the first physical sector of the partition is unused. WiniBoot
	doesn't know about this and will try to boot using the first
	physical sector. This usually results in a crash at boot time.

	If you have such a file system, I suggest that you run the new
	fdisk which will adjust the partition table for old file systems
	so that it points to the start of the Minix file system.

	Alternatively you can edit your partition table manually (a program
	like Norton's NU is good for this --- I haven't tried de) so
	that the Minix partition starts on an even sector by incrementing
	the starting sector, incrementing the base sector and decrementing
	the partition size. You may also want to adjust the size of
	the previous partition (to make it bigger).

Now, before you install WiniBoot on the hard disk, I suggest that you again play
using a floppy. Firstly, format a floppy. Then:

	cat /dev/hd0 >/dev/fd0
	# wait a few seconds then kill it

which should copy the boot sector from the hard disk to the floppy (wait
sufficient time to ensure that the boot sector is copied before killing the
process --- I usually wait until I hear the floppy head step to the next
track).

Now you can:

	laceup -w 1 /dev/fd0

which will write WiniBoot onto the floppy (yes, I know it sounds silly). Check
that the reported partitions are correct. You may want to choose a partition
other than 1 for the default boot partition.

You should now copy ShoeLace and the configuration file into the base directory 
of the hard disk. If you have the hard disk mounted as /usr then:

	cp /shoelace /usr/shoelace
	cp /etc/config /usr/etc/config

If you have the hard disk mounted as root, then ShoeLace should already be in
place as /shoelace and the configuration file as /etc/config.

Now boot the floppy. You should see the WiniBoot sign on and get a report of
the partitions available. Furthermore, WiniBoot should boot the *hard disk*
partitions according to the numbers you type in to the prompt. Note that if
you boot the floppy in drive 0, you will boot hard disk drive 0, floppy
drive 1 for hard disk drive 1, etc.

You can use this to check that the ShoeLace installation was successful without
stuffing up your hard disk partitions. Once you are happy with this you can:

	laceup -w 1 /dev/hd0

The configuration file can be edited to reflect your particular needs.
